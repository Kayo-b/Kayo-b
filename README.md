Greetings traveler,
-------

#### My name is Kayo Buchholz, and I'm a self-taught web-developer currently residing in Germany and focusing on the Javascript language and its frameworks. 


At this point in time I'm working on my API handling skills for web-applications through a [Weather App](https://kayo-b.github.io/weather.app/) implementation and deepening my understanding on data-structures and algorithms. 

Next on the bucket list is getting started with React.

I have a passion for creating intuitive, user-friendly interfaces and am constantly learning and experimenting with new technologies. In addition to my technical skills, I am also a strong problem-solver and communicator, which helps me to work well in team environments and to understand the needs of my clients.
On my GitHub profile, you can find examples of my work, such as personal projects that I have created to learn and experiment with new technologies. 

Thank you for visiting my profile, and please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to work together.
