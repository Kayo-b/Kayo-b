Greetings, traveler
-------

My name is Kayo, and I'm a self-taught web-developer currently residing in Germany and focusing on the Javascript language and its frameworks. 

At this point in my journey I'm focusing on my React skills and should be able to start building some bigger projects soon, maybe a e-commerce webpage, who knows...

You can check out my pinned projects below, if you're so inclined.

Thank you for visiting my profile, and please feel free to contact me at `kyo.bhz@gmail.com` if you have any questions or would like to work together.
